## Editors' Introduction

### Background and Motivation

The intersection of deep learning, foundational models, and geospatial science is reshaping how we observe, interpret, and manage our planet. Remote sensing analysts, Earth scientists, environmental specialists, and GIS professionals increasingly encounter machine learning tools in their workflows---yet for many, the path into this rapidly evolving landscape remains a challenge. Comprehensive textbooks struggle to keep pace with the field's velocity, while research literature often presupposes a depth of AI expertise that most applied Earth scientists have not yet developed. This book was created to bridge that gap.

The *EarthRISE Applied Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Book* is the product of more than seven years of community-driven knowledge sharing within the [Geospatial-Artificial Intelligence Working Group (Geo-AI WG)](https://sites.google.com/uah.edu/geo-ai-working-group/home). Rooted in three defining pillars: Building Capacity, Application Development, and Knowledge Sharing this volume represents the third pillar in action. A practitioner's guide distilled from real-world experience, peer collaboration, and a deep commitment to making advanced geospatial AI accessible to the broader Earth observation community. This book stands in a lineage of open, community-authored knowledge resources --alongside the [SAR Handbook](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/earth-observation-data-basics/sar-handbook) and the [Google Earth Engine Book](https://www.eefabook.org/)---sharing the same mission: to translate technical expertise into resources practitioners can immediately apply.

### What This Book Is---and What It Is Not

This is not an encyclopedic survey of artificial intelligence. The field evolves too quickly for any single volume to claim comprehensiveness, and we make no such claim. Instead, this book presents a curated collection of applied deep learning (DL) use cases ranging from common analytical needs  to broader considerations for practitioners, such as the ethics of artificial intelligence.

Think of this book as a "choose your own adventure." Readers with foundational knowledge can move directly to applied chapters aligned with their thematic interests---whether agriculture, forestry, water resources, urban environments, or disaster response. Each chapter pairs conceptual background with executable Jupyter notebooks designed to run across multiple platforms and frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services. Our goal is to meet practitioners where they are and lower the barrier to experimentation.

This first collection of chapters is designed with the future in mind. As the field continues to evolve, the book remains open to future submissions and collaborations as a living resource that grows alongside the community it serves.

### Audience

We assume readers arrive with meaningful geospatial expertise and familiarity with satellite imagery, raster and vector data, and common Earth observation workflows, but limited formal background in DL or AI. Our aim is to grow awareness, build practical skill, and empower readers to evaluate where and when DL approaches can meaningfully enhance their existing methods.

### How to Use This Book

Readers may progress sequentially from foundational data preparation through increasingly advanced problem sets, or navigate directly to chapters most relevant to their domain. Applied examples are cross-cutting by design: a workflow developed for crop-type mapping may illuminate approaches applicable to flood mapping, urban land cover classification, or ecosystem monitoring. We encourage readers to run, modify, and share the accompanying code. All notebooks are provided under open licenses.

## Meetings, Workshops, and Community Events

The chapters and methods presented in this book did not emerge in isolation. They are the product of years of structured exchanges, hands-on workshops, international collaborations, and community-driven hackathons that brought together practitioners, scientists, and thought leaders from across the scientific community. The events below trace the arc of that community from early capacity-building exchanges to the strategic planning now shaping the next generation of Geo-AI applications.

### Data Science and AI/ML Exchange (2019)
*Google Campus, Mountain View, CA, USA · Geo for Good 2019*

The 2019 Data Science Exchange marked the beginning of a sustained, network-wide effort to build applied machine learning (ML) capacity within the Geo-AI Working Group community. Held in tandem with the Google Geo for Good Summit, the exchange brought together scientists and practitioners to explore the use of data science, ML, and DL for Earth science applications. Participants worked hands-on with real-world problem sets, bringing label data from their own service areas to begin developing ML workflows using Google Earth Engine.

This event laid the organizational foundation for what would become the Geo-AI Working Group, establishing a shared vocabulary, collaborative norms, and a forward-looking agenda for applied AI within the network. We are grateful to Nick Clinton and Karin Tuxen-Bettman at Google for their support, as well as to partners from the University of San Francisco, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC), Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD), International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), and AGRHYMET.

### TensorFlow Technical Exchange (2020)
*Virtual · 21–25 September 2020*

Building directly on the 2019 exchange, the 2020 TensorFlow Technical Exchange extended the network's capacity-building efforts into a fully virtual format during the COVID pandemic. Over five days, participants from partner organizations engaged in training sessions, lectures, and hands-on demonstrations led by experts in AI, DL and ML for Earth sciences.

The exchange focused on applying TensorFlow within the Google Earth Engine framework, with each team working toward a defined ML workflow for an identified service application. Participants also explored emerging methodologies and libraries aligned with the Geo for Good 2020 summit. The event continued efforts initiated by the TensorFlow working group to provide network-wide expertise and support, and contributed to virtual programming at the Geo for Good 2021 summit.

### TensorFlow Exchange at Geo for Good (2022)
*Google Bay View Event Center, Mountain View, CA · October 4–6, 2022*

The 2022 exchange returned to an in-person format at Google's Bay View campus, deepening the technical work of previous years and formalizing the establishment of a Geo-AI Working Group. Participants focused on refining end-to-end ML workflows for solution/service co-development, with an emphasis on deploying trained models within Google Earth Engine and other open source platforms.

### Data Science and AI/ML Exchange (2023)
*Google Campus, Mountain View, CA · Geo for Good 2023*

The 2023 exchange expanded scope to encompass the rapidly evolving landscape of foundational models, large language models, and integrated Geo-AI workflows. In addition to continued capacity building in DL methods, participants worked in a build-a-thon format to develop and refine ML workflows for specific service applications, culminating in presentations at a dedicated session during the Geo for Good 2023 summit.

### Earth Observation Foundational Model Hackathon
*Geo for Good Summit, Dublin · 2023*

*Earth Observation Foundational Model (EOFM) and Large Earth Model (LEM) Integration into Google Earth Engine*

This hackathon challenged participants to explore how Earth observation foundational models could be effectively leveraged as part of operational geospatial workflows spanning Google Earth Engine and Google Cloud Platform. Working in collaborative teams, hackers hosted, deployed, and ran inference from models including NASA IMPACT and IBM's Prithvi and Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM), sourced from Hugging Face. Two integration pathways were explored: batch prediction via data export from GEE with a custom I/O pipeline, and online prediction directly from Earth Engine using the EE--Vertex AI connector. The hackathon was a defining moment for the community's understanding of how foundational models can complement traditional Earth observation workflows.

### Technical Work Planning: Geo-AI for Earth Science (2025)
*National Space Science and Technology Center, Huntsville, AL · 3–7 February 2025*

The February 2025 work planning meeting represented a strategic inflection point for the Geo-AI Working Group and Data Science area of NASA EarthRISE. Convened at the National Space Science and Technology Center, the meeting brought together organizational leads to formalize a shared strategic vision for Geo-AI and conduct roadmapping toward alignment with the Earth Action strategic framework.

### American Geophysical Union Sessions

Members of the Geo-AI Working Group have convened and chaired dedicated sessions at the American Geophysical Union annual meeting since 2022, building a scientific forum for presenting applied results and advancing community dialogue on ML for Earth science. The sessions have grown in scope each year, reflecting the rapid evolution of the field itself.

In 2022 in Chicago, the group organized and chaired a full suite of sessions under the title *Addressing Environmental Challenges and Sustainable Development Through Earth Science Applications Utilizing Machine Learning IV*, comprising two oral sessions, a poster session, and a virtual poster session. The call for that year centered on novel applications of ML, DL, and AI in data-sparse regions, with an emphasis on open data access, cloud computing, capacity building, and data democracy---themes that run throughout this book.

By 2023 in San Francisco, the session framing had broadened to foreground the rise of Geo-spatial AI and its intersection with geoscience, with a specific focus on innovative technical solutions addressing pressing environmental issues while advancing FAIR data principles: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse. The group presented *Applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning to Address Environmental Challenges and Sustainable Development Goals*, reflecting the community's expanding scope beyond DL fundamentals toward integrated, deployment-ready workflows.

The 2024 session in Washington, D.C., *Bridging the Gap: Leveraging Geo-Artificial Intelligence to Address Environmental Challenges*, acknowledged the moment the field was entering: one shaped by foundational models, large language models, and a new generation of Earth observation AI tools. The session description captured the stakes clearly---groundbreaking efforts in foundational model development, near real-time deforestation alerts, precision agriculture, and air quality monitoring---and called for collaboration between experts, non-profits, and applied scientists to ensure these capabilities reach the regions and communities that need them most.

Taken together, these sessions document not just the group's contributions to the scientific community, but the arc of the field itself: from establishing ML workflows to deploying foundational models at scale.
