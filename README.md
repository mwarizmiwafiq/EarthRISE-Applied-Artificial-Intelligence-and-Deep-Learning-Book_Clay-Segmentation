## Building Locally

The book is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). To render locally:

```bash
# Render both HTML and PDF
quarto render

# Preview with live reload
quarto preview

# Render a single chapter
quarto render 03_Semantic_Segmentation/01__Crop_Mapping/notebooks/Rice_Mapping_Bhutan_2021.ipynb
```

For PDF rendering you will also need TinyTeX:

```bash
quarto install tinytex
```

Notebook execution is disabled — chapters render from pre-computed outputs, so no Python environment is required to build the book.
